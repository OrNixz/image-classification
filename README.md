# Image Classification

Image Classification is a final submission on "Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula" from Dicoding course. This program is an implementation of image classification using machine learning techniques such as Data Preprocessing, Image Augmentation, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Model Training, Model Evaluation and Visualization, and Prediction on New Images.



## Dataset

For the dataset, we using **Rock-Paper-Scissors** dataset that you can download it on https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip or using this wget command: https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip.

This dataset includes of total 3000 labeled images, with 1,000 images for each class (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
